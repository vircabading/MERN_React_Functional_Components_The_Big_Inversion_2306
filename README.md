# The Big Inversion Read Me

## Description

This project remakes the "Prop It Up" project using functional components instead of class components

```
Create a component called PersonCard that accepts the following props:
1. firstName
2. lastName
3. weapon
4. maskColor
```

Then, display four PersonCard components that show four different people, using props.
